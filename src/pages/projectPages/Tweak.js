            <p> When I got my first iPhone at around 2018, there were small things about iOS 12 that felt lackluster, things that I saw that Android succeeded in. This was around the time when I invested in jailbreaking my phone, as I discovered that there were community-garnered system modifications, called "tweaks" that I could install to improve battery and add quality of life changes. </p>

            <p> The community is large and active in the number of users and developers creating tweaks; a majority of these tweaks served to fill in gaps that Apple failed to implement during early iOS versions that were both questioning of why Apple did not incorporate them into iOS and seeing how simple they were to fix by casual enthusiasts. As such, I wanted to contribute to the Jailbreak community by creating a tweak to fill in a gap. </p>

            <p> Up until iOS 16 was released in September 2022, there was no native way to cycle through multiple wallpapers on an iPhone, a feature that Android and Windows had decades ago. This was a frustration for me, so I went to create <b>DoABarrelWall</b>, a way to natively add this feature to set multiple homescreen and lockscreen wallpapers. </p>

                </figure>

                <figure onClick={function() {returnImage(images)}}>
                    <img id="media" className="project-images" type='image/jpg' src={images} width="100%" ></img>
                    <figcaption>
                        <i>Page to add, remove, and save images to act as wallpapers to cycle through.</i>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </p>

            <p> The tweak was well received by the <u><Link className="embedded-link"to="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/lkafdh/free_release_doabarrelwall_change_lockscreen_and/" target="_blank" >community</Link></u>. Upon release, I got positive feedback, many downloads, and requests for new features. As time went on, I not only implemented a majority these requests, but on a deeper level, optimized the tweak to utilize less memory and load backgrounds faster. I also learned a lot from two other people well-known in the community, and with their contribution, I learned new methods to collaborative and joint work to implement pre-existing libraries to my current project.
             </p>

            <p> Eventually, this tweak became end-of-life, due to Apple adding the feature to cycle through an album of pictures officially in iOS 16, so support for this tweak ended around iOS 15. However, I enjoyed the creation process immensely; this project was my first major project into creating something that others could use and freely experience. In the past, all of my projects have consisted to just run locally and were small tests that I would fool around with myself, so this project is a big accomplishment for me and and I'm extremely proud of what I have been able to create and the people I worked with. </p>
